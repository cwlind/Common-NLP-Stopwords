# Common-NLP-Stopwords
A list of stopwords (common words) you can remove from text during text analysis that don't add any value to the analysis or classification.

A couple different file formats (txt, csv, js) for ease of use. The JS file has "[" brackets "]" at the beginning and end of the list, with the intent of turning the list into an array.

The original list came from a (Python Stopwords discussion of NLTK)["https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280"], which culminated in the final list youcan get here:
